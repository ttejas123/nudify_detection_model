# Nudity Detection Model

## Overview

This is the first part of the Nudity Detection Model project. The goal of this phase is to scrape data from multiple websites, including images, videos, and URLs, which will be used for training and testing the model.

## Project Goals

1. **Data Collection:** Gather a diverse dataset from various sources, including websites with explicit and non-explicit content. This dataset will be the foundation for training and evaluating the Nudity Detection Model.

2. **Labeling:** Properly categorize and label the collected data, distinguishing between explicit and non-explicit content. This is essential for supervised machine learning.

## Data Sources

The data will be collected from multiple websites and sources, including but not limited to:
- [List of websites/sources]
- [List of websites/sources]
- [List of websites/sources]

## Data Scraping Tools

You will need to use web scraping tools and techniques to extract data from the sources. Popular tools and libraries for web scraping include:

- [Tool/library name 1]
- [Tool/library name 2]
- [Tool/library name 3]

## Data Labeling

After collecting the data, it is crucial to label it correctly. Ensure that explicit content is accurately categorized as such, and non-explicit content is labeled accordingly.

## Next Steps

Once the data collection and labeling phase is complete, you can proceed to the following parts of the project:

2. **Labeling:** Develop a labeling system or process to categorize images, URLs, and videos as explicit or non-explicit.

3. **Model Development:** Create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to achieve the project's goal. This model will be trained on the labeled dataset to detect nudity in images, URLs, and videos.

4. **API Development:** Build APIs to interact with the trained model. These APIs will be used in the final phase of the project to create a user-friendly application or website.

5. **App/Website/Plugin:** Develop a user-friendly application, website, or plugin that allows users to directly check content for explicit material using the trained model.

## Project Status

Currently, we are in the data collection phase. Stay tuned for updates as we progress through the project.
